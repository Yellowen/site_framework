A site framework for Ruby on Rails web framework inspired by Django site fremework.
The idea of this gem to transparently make Rails apps to work with different domains.

**Warning**: This gem is still on development. I'll be happy to have your feedback.

## Installation

Add `site_framework` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'site_framework'
```

and after installing your project dependencies using `bundle install` command. Install
**SiteFramework** migrations like:

```bash
rake site_framework:install:migrations
```

That's it.

## Usage

**SiteFramework** provides to solution to multi-site support.

In both solution you have to add a migration for your tables and
make them domain aware (ActiveRecord Only). e.g in your migration:

```ruby
# Make posts table domain aware
domain_aware(:posts)
```

If you're using **Mongoid** just add a reference to **SiteFramework::Domain** in your model.

When a request arrives to the Rails application `SiteFramework` will add three different
methods to `Rails.application`.

* **domain**: An instance of `SiteFramework::Domain` model which refer to current domain of
the request
* **domain_name**: Current domain as string.
* **Site**: An instance of `SiteFramework::Site` model which refer to current site.


### A) Rack middleware:
Simply add `SiteFramework::Middleware` to your middleware stack.

### B) Constrants
Just use `sites` DSL in your `routes.rb`. e.g:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  get 'home/index'

  # All the routes defined in this section will be domain aware.
  sites do
    root 'home#index'
  end
end
```

**Personally I prefer this (B) option since it's more Railish.**

### Model Concern
**SiteFramework** provides an **ActiveSupport** concern which transparently
makes your models aware of the current **Site** and **Domain**. By includeing
`SiteFramework::DomainAware` into your model, default scope of your model will
change to return only records which belongs to current **Site**.

This way you can use external gems with your multi-site application easily.
All you have to do is to open there models and include the given concern.

Piece of cake. right?
